    "# GKR for data-parallel binary circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Succinct arguments (often referred to as ZK, a term misused by the industry) allow a prover to convince a verifier that a given statement is true using an extremely short proof. A major bottleneck is the prover's overhead, which significantly slows down computation compared to native execution. The slowdown usually comes from following reasons:\n",
    "- The need for $N \\log{N}$ algorithms, like Number Theoretical Transforms (NTT) for polynomials; or expansive linear algorithms such as Multi-Scalar Multiplications (MSM) for elliptic curve operations.\n",
    "- The use of large field operations, such as the scalar field of BLS12-381, BN254 curves, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Justin Thaler proposed the use of Mersenne prime field in his [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/351.pdf) in 2013 section 6.2. The idea is to use a smaller field that has faster arithmetic to replace larger field. A later [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1482.pdf) in 2019 by Zhang et al. proposed the use of degree-2 extension field of Mersenne prime field to enable NTT and eventually leads to their adoptions in FRI polynomial commitment schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, none of these papers works well on binary circuits. The reason is that using Mersenee prime $2^{31} - 1$ to represent binary circuits is not efficient, wasted 30 bits of each field element. Or some people argue that we can use lookup table to speed up the computation, but each lookup operation costs $O(\\log{N})$ field operations, which is not efficient for binary circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we propose a new method to speed up the computation of binary circuits. We use the GKR protocol to prove the satisfiability of a data-parallel binary circuit. We show that, regardless of the field choice, we can reduce the cost of $N$ binary operations to $\\frac{N}{\\log{N}}$ field operations for the prover, while keeping the GKR verifier unchanged. This is purely an algorithmic improvement, and does not require any protocol-level changes. Note that we will require a proper binary polynomial commitment scheme to work with GKR protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Improved Sumcheck Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main contribution is a novel approach to performing sumchecks that significantly reduces the prover's workload. This method leverages the nature that certain values are binary in our protocol. We pack multiple binary bits—specifically, $\\frac{\\log(N)}{3}$ bits—into a single field element during protocol execution. This packing is efficient because each gate in our system has two inputs, limiting the number of possible packed values to $N^{2/3}$, where N relates to the problem size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize further, we create a precomputed lookup table of size $N^{2/3}$ before running the main protocol. This table contains all possible evaluations of the packed values. During the sumcheck, we evaluate the sum in segments, with each segment sized at $\\frac{\\log(N)}{3}$ bits. For each segment, we can quickly retrieve the required value from our precomputed table, eliminating the need for on-the-fly calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach combines clever bit packing, precomputation, and segmented evaluation to significantly speed up the sumcheck process, reducing the overall computational burden on the prover.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choice of the field\n",
    "The technique itself is field agnostic, but we highly recommend following fields for performance or compatibility:\n",
    "- Merseene prime fields: $GF(2^{31} - 1)$ for circuit descriptions and witnesses, with extension field $GF((2^{31} - 1)^3)$ for random challenges.\n",
    "- Binary field: $GF(2)$ for circuit descriptions and witnesses, with extension field $GF(2^{128})$ for random challenges.\n",
    "- BN254 for Ethereum compatibility."

The cost of field multiplication is $O((\\frac{\\lambda}{\\log{N}})^2)$ and the cost of field addition is $O(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\log{N}})$.
