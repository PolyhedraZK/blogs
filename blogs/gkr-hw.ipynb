    "# Accelerating Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems with Specialized Hardware: The Role of FPGA and ASIC in Enhancing Goldreich-Krawczyk-Rackoff (GKR) Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the evolving landscape of cryptographic protocols, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems stand out due to their ability to verify the correctness of information without revealing the information itself. A particular type of ZKP, the Goldreich-Krawczyk-Rackoff (GKR) protocol, has shown promising applications in privacy-preserving computations and secure multi-party computations. However, as the complexity and scale of these applications grow, so does the demand for more efficient computation methods. This is where specialized hardware like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Need for Speed in ZKP\n",
    "\n",
    "ZKPs are computationally intensive and require significant resources to execute, especially in scenarios involving complex data sets and high-frequency verification demands. The GKR protocol, while efficient in theoretical terms, can benefit greatly from hardware acceleration to meet practical performance requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FPGA and ASIC: Catalysts for Enhanced GKR Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "FPGAs and ASICs provide customizable, high-performance computing solutions that can be specifically tailored to enhance the GKR protocol. Hereâ€™s how these technologies can make a difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customization for Optimization**: FPGAs allow for the programming of hardware to execute specific tasks such as the polynomial evaluations and interactive proofs required in GKR. ASICs take this a step further by offering optimized, fixed-functionality chips designed for executing GKR operations at even higher speeds and lower power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallel Processing Capabilities**: Both FPGA and ASIC technologies excel in handling parallel processes. This is crucial for scaling ZKP computations, enabling simultaneous processing of multiple proof validations or generation tasks, significantly cutting down the overall computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Energy Efficiency**: With the increasing emphasis on sustainable computing, the energy efficiency of FPGAs and ASICs is a significant advantage. These technologies consume less power compared to general-purpose processors, especially when tuned for specific tasks like those involved in GKR."

    "## Limitation? Accelerate GKR in Linear Time\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of original Sum-check protocol used in [Tha'13] leads to $O(2^{2\\cdot log(n)}) = O(n^2)$ time complexity, which is not applicable for hardware implementation. A notable advancement in the optimization of GKR protocols comes from exploiting the inherent sparsity found in arbitrary circuits. According to research presented in the [XZZ'19], by strategically analyzing and utilizing the sparse characteristics of circuits, it is possible to significantly enhance the efficiency of GKR computations. This approach focuses an technique that break Sum-check computation (consists of multiple round of Multi-linear Extension, MLE evaluation) into two phases, which leads to construct two small bookkeeping tables in $O(n)$ time. As a result, the original $O(n^2)$ problem breaks into two $O(n)$ problems, making hardware specialization practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to this method lies in a careful construction of bookkeeping table before each Sum-check phase by exploiting the sparsity between each neighboring layers throughout GKR protocol. By employing linear-time algorithms that adapt to the sparsity levels of the circuits, the prover phase of the GKR can be optimized. This results in a more streamlined process that not only speeds up the computation but also minimizes the resources required for generating and verifying proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is particularly effective for large-scale applications where the arbitrary circuit complexity can otherwise lead to bottlenecks. By harnessing the sparsity, systems can achieve linear scalability in terms of both time and space, making it feasible to implement more complex and secure zero-knowledge proofs in practical, real-world systems."

    "### What is the upper bound?\n",

    "\n",
    "![Figure 1](hw-example.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "GKR Accelerator contains a flatten circuit structure with two small physical SRAMs, as the physical storage of two bookkeeping tables. The neighboring two GKR layers can be streamed into GKR accelerator. For each round of Sum-check protocol, GKR accelerator requests one random challenge via hard-wired logics (or just tiny CPU) from *Proof Transcript SRAM* and proceed to next round.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do a simple calculation to study the upper bound on an example arbitrary circuit with 100 layers, 1024 gates per layer. Assuming the MLE of each round Sum-check are completely flattened and unlimited fast, the bottleneck becomes the number of time that GKR accelerator request for random oracle from Proof transcript SRAM. The number of random oracle request time is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "100\\ layers \\times (2 \\times log_{2}(1024) + 2) = 2,200\\ challenges\n",
    "$$\n",

However, this problem can be solved by applying the technique from [XZZ'19] where the problem of $O(n^2)$ is broken into two $O(n)$ problems and each problem can be solved by sacrificing a bookkeeping table with $O(n)$ size, leading hardware specialization to be practical."

    "From the calculations discussed above, we can observe that on a typical enterprise-grade FPGA, completing one layer of the GKR proof requires about 30,000 to 100,000 multiplication clock cycles when equipped with a moderate number of multipliers (10-15). In the case of sumcheck for 10 variables, at least 22 hash operations are necessary to generate all the random challenges. If we do not utilize a hardened hash function, and instead perform hash computations using a CPU soft core, the time required for hashing will be on the same order of magnitude as the time needed for multiplications (usually each hash function will take around 10,000 cycles on general purpose devices.). Therefore, it is essential to implement hardened SHA3-256 to efficiently generate random challenges.\n",

    "The calculations mentioned previously primarily aim to establish the order of magnitude for the performance of various components to achieve the desired performance metrics within the given hardware parameters. They are not actual performance indicators of a product. It's important to recognize the practical scenario where each layer of the GKR might require between 1 to 10 MB of data, assuming an average of 5 MB per layer. Considering the computation time for each layer is 100,000 cycles, and with a system frequency of 200 MHz, we need to calculate the necessary bandwidth.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Cycle Time:** 1 \\/ 200,000,000 seconds per cycle = $5e^{-9}$ seconds per cycle.\n",
    "- **Total Time for 100,000 cycles:**  0.0005 seconds.\n",

However, the number of multipliers does not solely determine the acceleration ratio; about ten multipliers (approximately the logarithm of the number of gates per layer) are sufficient due to the properties of SumCheck.\n",

    "- The bandwidth requirement for each SumCheck proof acceleration core is likely to exceed 10 GB/s. Considering the limitations of bandwidth, strategically utilizing available bandwidth is crucial to achieving a high end-to-end acceleration ratio.\n",

    "The intersection of cryptographic protocols like GKR with advanced hardware technologies such as FPGA and ASIC represents a pivotal development in the field of data security. By harnessing the power of specialized hardware, the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs can be made more efficient, paving the way for broader adoption and more robust applications in the digital world.\n",
