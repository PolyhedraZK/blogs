# Foundation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a fascinating and powerful concept in the field of cryptography and computer science, enabling one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement about the prover’s secret is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement. This seemingly paradoxical idea has profound implications for privacy, security, and trust in digital interactions. In this blog, we'll explore the foundation of zero-knowledge proofs, their principles, how they work, and their applications.

At their core, zero-knowledge proofs are about proving knowledge without revealing it. Imagine you have a secret recipe for a cake, and you want to prove to someone that you know the recipe without actually giving it away. Zero-knowledge proofs allow for this kind of interaction in the digital world, where the "secret recipe" could be anything from a password to a cryptographic key.

Zero-knowledge proofs are characterized by three essential properties:

- **Completeness**: If the statement is true, an honest verifier will always be convinced by an honest prover.
- **Soundness**: If the statement is false, no deceptive prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability.
- **Zero-knowledge**: If the statement is true, the verifier learns nothing other than the fact that the statement is true. The verifier gains no additional information about the statement itself.

There are two additional properties that are useful for real-world applications:

- **Knowledge Soundness**: If a verifier (the party receiving the proof) accepts proof from a prover (the party generating the proof), then the prover truly knows or possesses the information or secret in question. Essentially, it implies that a dishonest prover cannot convince a verifier of a false statement except with some negligible probability.
- **Succinctness**: A proof is considered succinct if it can be verified quickly, typically in time that is much less than the time to read the prover’s secret input and generate the proofs. Succinct proofs require the transmission of a small amount of data compared to the size of the data or statements being proven.

The mechanics of ZKPs can be illustrated through a classic example: the Alibaba cave problem. Imagine a circular cave with a door that can only be opened with a secret word. The cave has an entrance and paths A and B meet at the door. The prover wants to prove to the verifier that they know the secret word without revealing it.

1. The prover enters the cave and chooses one path, A or B, at random.
2. The verifier waits outside, enters the cave, and shouts which path the prover should use to return.
3. If the prover knows the secret word, they can open the door (if needed) and return via the requested path, proving they know the secret without revealing it.
4. This interaction is repeated multiple times to reduce the chance that the prover is simply guessing.

Before we dive deeper into the fascinating world of zero-knowledge proofs, let's first take a step back and review some fundamental mathematical concepts: finite fields, abstract algebra, and polynomials. These concepts are not only crucial for understanding the theoretical underpinnings of zero-knowledge proofs but also provide the essential building blocks that enable the practical applications of this technology in cryptography and beyond.

Understanding these foundational concepts will equip us with the necessary tools to appreciate the complexity and beauty of zero-knowledge proofs, as well as their significance in securing digital communication and transactions. So, let's embark on a brief journey through these mathematical landscapes to set the stage for our exploration of zero-knowledge proofs.

## Abstract Algebra

Abstract algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces. These structures generalize the algebraic concepts you might be familiar with from basic arithmetic and linear algebra, focusing on the properties and patterns that emerge from their operations and interactions.

- **Groups** provide a framework for studying symmetry, a single operation of addition, and their properties.
- **Rings** extend the concept of groups by introducing a second operation, typically resembling multiplication, alongside addition.
- **Fields** are rings where division (except by zero) is possible, providing a rich structure for analysis and application.

Abstract algebra forms the theoretical backbone of many modern cryptography algorithms, where the properties of these algebraic structures are used to construct secure systems.

## Finite Fields

A finite field, also known as a Galois field, is a mathematical system composed of a finite number of elements where you can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero) operations that satisfy the field axioms. Finite fields are crucial in cryptography, error-correcting codes, and various algorithms because they provide a well-defined, closed set of elements with predictable properties.

A simple example of a finite field is the set of integers modulo a prime number $p$, denoted as $ \mathbb{F} _p $. In this field, the elements are the integers $ \{0, 1, \ldots, p-1\} $, and all arithmetic operations are performed modulo $p$.

### Formal Definition

A finite field $ \mathbb{F} $ is a set containing a finite number of elements, equipped with two binary operations—addition (+) and multiplication (·)—that adhere to the following axioms:

1. **Closure**: For every $ a, b \in \mathbb{F} $, both $ a + b $ and $ a \cdot b $ are in $ \mathbb{F} $.
2. **Associativity**: For all $ a, b, c \in \mathbb{F} $, the equations $ (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) $ and $ (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) $ hold.
3. **Commutativity**: For all $ a, b \in \mathbb{F} $, $ a + b = b + a $ and $ a \cdot b = b \cdot a $.
4. **Identity Elements**: There exist two distinct elements, 0 and 1 in $ \mathbb{F} $, such that for every $ a \in \mathbb{F} $, $ a + 0 = a $ and $ a \cdot 1 = a $.
5. **Additive Inverses**: For every $ a \in \mathbb{F} $, there exists an element $ -a \in \mathbb{F} $ such that $ a + (-a) = 0 $.
6. **Multiplicative Inverses**: For every $ a \in \mathbb{F} $ with $ a \neq 0 $, there exists an element $ a^{-1} \in \mathbb{F} $ such that $ a \cdot a^{-1} = 1 $.
7. **Distributivity**: For all $ a, b, c \in \mathbb{F} $, $ a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) $.

## Polynomials

Polynomials are mathematical expressions involving a sum of powers in one or more variables multiplied by coefficients. For example, $ f(x) = a _n x^n + a _{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a _1 x + a _0 $ is a polynomial in one variable ($x$), and $ g(x, y) = b _{mn} x^m y^n + \cdots + b _{01} y + b _{00} $ is a polynomial in two variables ($x$ and $y$). Polynomials play a central role in numerous areas of mathematics and science, from solving equations and modeling physical phenomena to forming the basis of polynomial-based cryptographic schemes.

In the context of zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic applications, polynomials can be used in various ways, including constructing polynomial equations that have specific properties or solutions, or as part of more complex structures like polynomial commitment schemes, where they enable efficient verification of properties without revealing the polynomial itself.

A multivariate polynomial is a polynomial that involves more than one variable. Formally, it can be expressed as

\[ f(x _1, x _2, \ldots, x _n) = \sum a _{i _1 i _2 \ldots i _n} x _1^{i _1} x _2^{i _2} \cdots x _n^{i _n} \]

where $ n $ represents the number of variables, $ a _{i _1 i _2 \ldots i _n} $ are the coefficients, which can be real or complex numbers, and $ i _1, i _2, \ldots, i _n $ are non-negative integers representing the powers of each variable. The total degree of a multivariate polynomial is the highest total degree of its monomials, where the total degree of a monomial is the sum of the powers of all its variables.

A multilinear polynomial in $ n $ variables is a special type of multivariate polynomial where each variable in any term appears at most with the power of one (i.e., powers are either 0 or 1). For such polynomials, each variable combination can either be present or absent in a term, leading to each term being uniquely defined by a subset of the variables. For example, with two variables $ x $ and $ y $, the possible terms are 1, $ x $, $ y $, and $ xy $. Therefore,

 the number of different terms, and hence the number of coefficients, in a multilinear polynomial with $ n $ variables is $ 2^n $. This is derived from the fact that each variable can either be included or excluded from each term independently. The concept of multilinear extensions relates to extending a discrete function defined on subsets of a set to a continuous function on the cube $ [0, 1]^n $. If we consider fitting a multilinear polynomial to $ 2^n $ points where each point corresponds to a vertex of the hypercube defined by $ [0, 1]^n $, and there are $ 2^n $ coefficients in the polynomial.

## Schwartz-Zippel Lemma

The Schwartz-Zippel Lemma is an important principle in algebra, offering a probabilistic approach to ascertain whether a polynomial is identical to zero. Specifically, it posits that for a non-zero polynomial $ f(x _1, x _2, \ldots, x _n) $ over a field, with a total degree $ d $, the probability that $ f(a _1, a _2, \ldots, a _n) = 0 $ over a randomly chosen set of inputs $ a _1, a _2, \ldots, a _n $ from a finite subset $ S $ of the field is upper-bounded by $ \frac{d}{|S|} $. This lemma is instrumental in algorithms for polynomial identity testing, where it provides an efficient means of verifying polynomial equivalence by demonstrating that if two polynomials are not identical, then their difference has a low probability of evaluating to zero over a random selection of inputs, namely, $ 1 - \frac{d}{|S|} $ with probability $ 1 - \frac{d}{|S|} $.

The Schwartz-Zippel Lemma is especially useful in the construction of zero-knowledge proofs, since it enables the verifier to check the information of a big polynomial with few points.

Formally, if $ f $ is a polynomial of degree $ d $ not identically zero, then for randomly chosen $ a _1, a _2, \ldots, a _n $, the lemma asserts:

$$ \Pr[f(a _1, a _2, \ldots, a _n) = 0] \leq \frac{d}{|S|} $$
